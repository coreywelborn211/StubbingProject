	This is a simple HTML page that displays 10 buttons and has a body to display text.
	The functionality of the page is written in JavaScript.
	When a client clicks a button in the left column, a cooresponding function is called in scripts.js.
	These functions are the stubs of the Stubbing Project, and inform that it hasn't been implemented.
	There is a default body for when no button has been selected.
	Also included is an exit button to return to the default body via the defaultBody function.
